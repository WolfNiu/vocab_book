  roots:
    hud: "*(s)keu- | to cover, conceal"

  roots:
    skim: "*(s)keu- | to cover, conceal"
  exp: 要讲skim就必须先从一个比它更不常用的词scum(15799,-1)说起。scum的本意是a layer of dirt or froth on the surface of a liquid，很明显和cover有关。而skim指的正是把这层dirt(or froth)抹掉的动作(remove scum)。

  sent: You've left the garden hose on.
  roots:
    hose: "*(s)keu- | to cover, conceal"

  exp: 第一眼看去breed似乎和*bhreu-没什么关系——总不能是bubble表示卵泡儿吧。实际上这个词借的是*bhreu-中to keep warm的那层意思。比如你想孵个蛋，就肯定要给它个温暖的环境。

  roots:

    broil: "*bhreu- | to boil, bubble, effervesce, burn"
  exp: 要想明白这个词就需要回顾一下cooking的过程。一开始各种原材料各自为政，broil之后就混在一起了。所以*bhreu-其实还有to mix, mingle这一层意思(mix和mingle中的ming也可以互换，嘿嘿)。所以说emboril就表示把大家mix在了一起，互相吵吵嘴打打架什么的，所以释义里才会有"deeply invovled"这样的词。

  exp: hectic的本意是continuous, habitual的感觉，因为continuous，所以很忙碌。而hold恰恰又有"持续"的意思。在字母互换上这词很奇怪，主要是从*segh-在发展过程中有的词把前面那个s给省掉了(这种互换在epoch(13197,17)中也有所体现)。后面ct=g倒是很常见。
