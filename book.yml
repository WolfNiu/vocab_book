  exp: 这个词巨难想，咱们一步一步来。首先dwell的本意是dust, smoke，二者都有deceive(迷惑)的属性(其实中文里也有"眼前一片迷雾"的表达方法)。而迷雾会让你停在一个地方踟蹰不前，所以又引申成了"定居"的意思。可见有些词所需脑洞之大，非常人所能想象。

  exp: 要讲skim就必须先从一个比它更不常用的词scum(15799,-1)说起。scum的本意是a layer of dirt or froth on the surface of a liquid，很明显和cover有关。而skim指的正是把这层dirt(or froth)抹掉的动作(remove scum)。

    broil: "*bhreu- | to boil, bubble, effervesce, burn"
  exp: 要想明白这个词就需要回顾一下cooking的过程。一开始各种原材料各自为政，broil之后就混在一起了。所以*bhreu-其实还有to mix, mingle这一层意思(mix和mingle中的ming也可以互换，嘿嘿)。所以说emboril就表示把大家mix在了一起，互相吵吵嘴打打架什么的，所以释义里才会有"deeply invovled"这样的词。

  exp: 这个词的词根发展很有意思。我们可以看到在PIE root *no-men-中，n在前，m在后；而到了moniker中，则是m在前，n在后。这个很正常，因为人一个词读多了之后就挺容易前后颠倒 [[这里举个例子]] 。比如，另外注意moniker在词义上也可以表示昵称(e.g. honey)、笔名之类的，所以和name的用法并不完全一样。
