  exp: 借用plait表达那种身陷复杂、盘根错节的境地的那种感觉。注意，这个词用于表示touch situation的时候是从*plek-来的；而用于表示pledge的时候则是从另一个PIE root *dlegh-(to engage oneself)来的，因此可以认为这两个plight即是homophone(读音相同的单词，比如two和too)又是homograph(拼写相同的单词，比如row [roh] "line" 和 row [rou] "fight")。

  roots:
    dwell: "*dheu- | dust, vapor, smoke"
  exp: 这个词巨难想，咱们一步一步来。首先dwell的本意是dust, smoke，二者都有deceive(迷惑)的属性(其实中文里也有"眼前一片迷雾"的表达方法)。而迷雾会让你停在一个地方踟蹰不前，所以又引申成了"定居"的意思。可见有些词所需脑洞之大，非常人所能想象。

  exp: 要想明白这个词就需要回顾一下cooking的过程。一开始各种原材料各自为政，broil之后就混在一起了。所以*bhreu-其实还有to mix, mingle这一层意思(mix和mingle中的ming也可以互换，嘿嘿)。所以说emboril就表示把大家mix在了一起，互相吵吵嘴打打架什么的，所以释义里才会有"deeply invovled"这样的词。

  exp: 这个词的词根发展很有意思。我们可以看到在PIE root *no-men-中，n在前，m在后；而到了moniker中，则是m在前，n在后。这个很正常，因为人一个词读多了之后就挺容易前后颠倒 [[这里举个例子]] 。比如，另外注意moniker在词义上也可以表示昵称(e.g. honey)、笔名之类的，所以和name的用法并不完全一样。

  freq: 8616

  sent: I said I would abide by their decision.
  roots:
    a: a- | on, in, into
    bide: "*bheidh- | to trust, confide, persuade"
  exp: 想理解abide，首先要理解它的同源词bide(19771,104)为什么表示"remain or stay somewhere"。一般来说，我们信任(trust)一个人的时候，就会选择呆(remain)在其身边。因此bide就是await trustingly的感觉。而abide需要直接用bide来记——什么叫accept呢，就是我一直呆(remain)在那儿也不动了，接受现实；如果不接受或者不想忍受的话，则会避而远之。从"呆着"发展成"接受"，这也是一个很好的从很原始具体的意思发展成比较抽象的意思的例子。

  roots:
    fool: "*bhel- | to blow, swell"
  exp: 乍一看fool和to blow没啥关系，但是我把fool的一个近义词举出来你就明白了——empty-headed person。所以老外眼中的大傻子就是"脑袋像气儿吹(blow)的一样"，也就是没有脑子的感觉，这和中文里说别人"一脑袋浆糊"有异曲同工之妙。另一个很明显的证据是fool这个词在很久以前表示windbag, bellow(风箱)。当然啦，bellow(12620,41)和fool也是同源词。
